- Initial questions / unknowns
 Are we making exact replicates of the post card or just have to have the same elements as the example?
 
- What elements do you expect are needed for this design?
Images, textboxes, background image, border for images

- What properties do you expect these to have?
Images: Image and alt text (slot)
Textboxes: slot
Background image: Title

- Slots?
 Yes, for the textboxes and images

- What CSS / Styling unknowns are there presently?
 Some elements overlay other elements. We are wondering if there is a CSS method that will allow us to choose which element overlays over which or if its just a matter of transparancy.

Click on images: changes border. Left image: Tape becomes more transparent. Right image: Inner border of the background image appears. 
Click ont textboxes: Can edit text boxes
