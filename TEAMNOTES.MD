### Meeting Date

#### What we did:


#### What we'll do next


## Status check ins
These are dedicated status check-ins as this is a multi-week project
### Check-in 1
#### What project / issue your picking (link to it)
https://github.com/elmsln/issues/issues/879
#### A hand drawn / computer sketch / XD / some annotation visually of what needs to be done or what pieces get broken out. This could be drawn on over top of a screen shot of the item or a photo of whiteboard sketches. Whatever make the most sense to you.

![PostCard Elements](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/63626720/140686959-0617c25d-ce98-47db-8c15-bc53dc247a48.jpg)

#### Initial questions / unknowns
 Are we making exact replicates of the post card or just have to have the same elements as the example?
 
#### What elements do you expect are needed for this design?
Images, textboxes, background image, border for images

#### What properties do you expect these to have?
- Images: Image and alt text (slot)
- Textboxes: slot
- Background image: Title

#### Slots?
 Yes, for the textboxes and images

#### What CSS / Styling unknowns are there presently?
 Some elements overlay other elements. We are wondering if there is a CSS method that will allow us to choose which element overlays over which or if its just a matter of transparancy. 
 
#### What states does it have? can you click / hover to engage with it?
- Click on images: changes border. Left image: Tape becomes more transparent. Right image: Inner border of the background image appears. 
- Click ont textboxes: Can edit text boxes

#### What properties need mapped to HAX / the storybook? What can the user interact with?
 Images and textboxes


### Check-in 2
- Ran into webpack problem and switched over to yarn 
- Created the framework of the postcard. Divided the sections of the postcard into a grid format
- Implemented the slots
- Wrote the design elements
- Have to work on overlaying the postage. Looking into how to put the tape into the card. 
### Check-in 3
- Changed our project selection to the trading cards
- Created the main frame of the trading card. Added slots for necessary part of the code. Card is mainly static right now.
- Design is pretty much completed. We need to just focus on the functionality now.
